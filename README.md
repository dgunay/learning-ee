# EE/CE Self-Study Repository

This repository is a collection of my resources, notes, and project work as I learn about Electrical Engineering (EE) and Computer Engineering (CE), with a focus on embedded systems. Here you'll find curated learning materials, summaries, and hands-on projects that document my progress and understanding in these fields.

- **Resources:** Books, tools, and references useful for EE/CE self-study
- **Curriculum:** Structured learning path and milestones
- **Projects:** Practical exercises and experiments

This repo is intended as both a personal learning log and a resource for others interested in a similar journey.
